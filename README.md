# Zig rules for Please 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is very much in the alpha stage build. 

This repo is a Zig plug-in for [Please build system](https://please.build).

## Why not use Zig's built-in build?

I believe this is a matter of taste. I am not fond of a language-specific build systems. That's why.

## Supported rules

- zig_toolchain
- zig_library
- zig_binary
